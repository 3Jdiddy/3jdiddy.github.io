        <h2>Worship Service â”€ Sundays at 10:00 AM</h2>
        <p>We are gathering in-person in the sanctuary every Sunday.  The service also is live-streamed via  Facebook (and does not require you to have a Facebook account).  We hope that you'll join us for worship at 10:00 a.m. on Sunday Mornings.</p>
        <p>To watch on Facebook Live: Go to Second Congo's Facebook Page a bit before 10 AM on Sunday mornings and look for the Live Stream. Please note that currently the chat/comment functions may not be monitored during the live service, so we encourage you to submit your prayer requests prior to Sunday mornings by email at pastor@secondcongo.org.</p>
        <p>To watch on YouTube: Go to Second Congo's YouTube Channel and look for the LIVE banner.</p>
